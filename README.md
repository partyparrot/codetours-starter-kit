# codetours-starter-kit

### What is this?

This is a CodeTour designed to walk you through the steps required to make a CodeTour. You can make a CodeTour of any open source project, even one you don't have commit access to.

### How should I use this?

**If this is your first time making a tour, take a few minutes to check out our [CodeTour for CodeTour](https://www.codetours.xyz/tour/partyparrot/codetours-starter-kit)** (it's meta, we know). We promise everything will make a lot more sense after taking this tour.

If you've done it before, here's the TL;DR in case you need a reminder:

1. Fork this starter kit, or another existing tour
2. Edit the config file, content, and code links
3. Import your code tour [here](https://www.codetours.xyz/)
